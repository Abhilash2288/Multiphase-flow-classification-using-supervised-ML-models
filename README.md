## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Multiphase flow refers to simultaneous flow of gas, liquid, and/or solid phases.  
Accurate classification of flow regimes is crucial in industries like oil & gas, chemical processing, and energy.  
This work applies **supervised machine learning** models enhanced with **Bayesian Optimization** for hyperparameter tuning to classify **three-phase (airâ€“waterâ€“oil) flow regimes in horizontal pipes**.
